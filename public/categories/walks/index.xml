    <description><![CDATA[A walk along the River Brent and Thames, passing through Brentford.
Route This is the approximate route for the walk. You can see that it mostly follows the River Brent and Thames and finishes up in Hammersmith station.
Sites The walk started in Hanwell, which is west of Ealing and south of Wembley. At the time of the walk, the Elizabeth line had just opened so it was also my first time on the new service.]]></description>
