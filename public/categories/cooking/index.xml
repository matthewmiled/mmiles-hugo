    <description><![CDATA[This is my first experiment with enriched dough, and the result is a bread that is chewy and soft without the crusty exterior found with focaccia and typical baguettes. These are perfect for sandwiches and are best on the day of baking. Ingredients Makes 4 rolls:
400g bread flour
260ml semi-skimmed milk (65% hydration)
8g diastatic malt powder
20g olive oil
8g salt

    <description><![CDATA[Searing the meat on the hob and finishing in the the same pan in the oven creates a crispy and browned outside, whithout drying out the chicken. Make sure to create the sauce in the same pan as the chicken is cooked in to introduce more browned flavour. Ingredients Cooking the chicken:
1 large breast, thigh or leg per person (skin-on)
Fresh sprigs of thyme
Fresh sprigs of rosemary]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Slow cooking the meat in a cast iron dutch oven is essential for this recipe. More vegetables can be added depending on preference, but adding just carrots for the last hour of cooking gives a simple contrast and ensures that the meat is super tender whilst the carrots have a slightly harder al dente texture. Served with baked mashed potatoes.
Ingredients Serves approx 5 people:
~1.5kg joint of beef chuck (shoulder)]]></description>
