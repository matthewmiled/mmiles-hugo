    <description><![CDATA[An experiment with an AWS service to host a Django app.
In general, these are the key things that I wanted to achieve in order to say that a web app has been ‘deployed’:
Support the use of a custom domain name.
Support the use of HTTPS via SSL certificate.
Auto redirect to HTTPS when there is any incoming traffic.
Support the upload of images and ‘articles’ in django admin.]]></description>
