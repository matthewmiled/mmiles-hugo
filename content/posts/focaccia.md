> A lean dough recipe inspired by the Italian classic. The exterior is slightly firm and crispy whilst the high hydration dough produces a fluffy and aerated crumb. This recipe is scaled to create a slightly thicker bread that is delicious on its own or ideal for sandwiches.

### Ingredients

**Gives a ~2.5cm thick bread when cooked in a 1120cm2 metal oven dish:**
- 790g bread flour

- 586ml warm water (~75% hydration)

- 5g dough enhancer (optional)

- 16g olive oil

- 16g salt

- 16g instant yeast

**Toppings:**
- Olives (optional)

- Tomatoes (optional)

- Fresh rosemary (optional)

- Additional toppings of choice

___

### Directions

**Forming the dough:**

1. Combine flour, oil, dough enhancer and sugar in a bowl and add to food processor.

2. Combine warm water, yeast and salt in a glass/bowl and stir to mix. Then add to food processor.

3. Process for about 30 seconds and check for window paning to signify gluten development.

**Dough rise & gluten development:**

4. Add the sticky processed dough to an oiled bowl (add flour to hands or dough to ease with handling, but not too much) and cover.

5. Leave the dough for 20 minutes and then perform a 'stretch and fold'. This involves lifting one side of the dough as high as possible (without tearing) and then folding back onto itself. Do this for each of the 4 sides, and leave to rest for another 20 minutes. This is one set of stretch and folds. Stretching and folding (in combination with the high hydration dough) accelerates gluten development which gives the aerated and fluffy interior.

6. Perform an additional 3 sets of stretch and folds, leaving at least 20 minutes between each set.

7. Place covered bowl in fridge if fermenting overnight, or leave out at room temperature if cooking same day.

8. The dough can be left in the fridge for up to 7 days. Performing a additional few stretch and folds will increase gluten development, but is not necessary.

**Forming the bread:**

9. Generously oil and salt the bottom of the oven dish and tip the dough into it. Massage the dough into the corners as much as possible without pressing down too hard and de-gassing. If the dough is springing back, leave for 10 mins and knead the final parts into the corners.

10. Make a pizza sauce by adding butter, olive oil, crushed garlic, dried herbs and salt and pepper to a saucepan. Simmer until desired thickness is achieved. The sauce can be hand blended for a smoother sauce.

11. Cover the bread/tray and leave to rise for a few hours. 

___

**Assembly & cooking:**

12. Pre-heat oven to slightly lower than it's max temperature.

13. Half some olives and tomatoes and set aside to add to the dough later.

14. Create an emulsion of olive oil, water and garlic powder and set aside to add to the dough later.

15. Uncover the dough and optionally add some light dimples. Add toppings to the bread and pour over the oil and water emulsion.

16. Add some rosemary and a final pinch of salt. 

17. Place in middle shelf of oven and cook for approximately 20 minutes. The top should be golden, firm and crispy. The bread should have a spring when pressed.

18. Leave to cool for about 20 mins and scrape out.
