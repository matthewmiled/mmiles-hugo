> A thin chewy base and low-moisture mozzarella gives the typical New York style, and this recipe uses a quick garlic butter for the crust. A food processor is the perfect tool to quickly develop gluten within the dough, and the dough can be made on the same day or up to a week in advance.

### Directions

**Forming the dough:**

1. Combine flour, oil, dough enhancer and sugar in a bowl and add to food processor.

2. Combine warm water, yeast and salt in a glass/bowl and stir to mix. Then add to food processor.

3. Process for about 30 seconds and check for window paning to signify gluten development.

**Dough rise & gluten development:**

4. Add the sticky processed dough to a bowl (add flour to hands or dough to ease with handling, but not too much) and cover.

5. Place covered bowl in fridge if fermenting overnight, or leave out at room temperature if cooking same day.

6. The dough can be left in the fridge for up to 7 days. Performing a few stretch and folds will increase gluten development, but is not necessary.

7. On the day of cooking, split the dough in 2 and form into balls by closing one end and scraping on surface to cause friction. 

8. Place balls back in fridge and cover. For optimal results, the dough balls should be cold when forming into pies.

**Making the pies:**

9. Grate the mozzarella (this is easier if it has been frozen) and then place back in freezer so it is frozen/cold when it comes to cooking. This makes sure it doesn't melt too quickly and burn when cooking.

10. Make a pizza sauce by adding butter, olive oil, crushed garlic, dried herbs and salt and pepper to a saucepan. Simmer until desired thickness is achieved. The sauce can be hand blended for a smoother sauce.

11. Pre-heat a pizza stone in the oven at the hottest temperature for at least an hour.

12. Take the balls out of the fridge and lightly flour hands, the surface and the balls.

13. Form into very thin pies by firstly massaging the dough to form a crust, and then by picking the dough up and letting gravity thin them out. 

14. Place the pies on a pizza peel or thin chopping board that has been well dusted with cornmeal. The cornmeal acts as 'rollers' to help slide the dough onto the hot stone.

**Assembly & cooking:**

15. Add a layer of tomato sauce, then grated parmesan and then mozzarella (out of the freezer) and other toppings.

16. Without taking the stone out of the oven, slide the pizza onto the stone, using the cornmeal to assist. If this is too dificult and the dough is sticking to the board, just take the pizza stone out of the oven and take some time to carefully slide in on. High hydration doughs can be very sticky, and if the dough spends too long on the board it will likely not budge easily. 

17. Cook for about 10 mins until the cheese has melted and crust has risen.

18. Take out of the oven and leave to rest for about 5-10 mins. This is important in order to maintain structure.

19. Whilst it is cooling, make a quick garlic butter using either garlic powder or fresh garlic. Brush the melted garlic butter onto the crust.

20. Add fresh basil and slice.
