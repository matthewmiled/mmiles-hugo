> This chutney was made in April 2021 to give it time to mature for Christmas. It mostly contains red vegetables and ended up very dark in colour with moderate heat. It uses a typical ratio of vegetables, vinegar, sugar and spices.

### Ingredients

**Vegtables:**

- 1.5kg red bell peppers

- 1kg red onions

- 500g tomatoes

- 2 heads of garlic

- 3 chilli peppers

**Vinegar:**
- 1l red wine vinegar

**Sugar:**

**Spices:**
- 1 teaspoon curry powder

- 1 teaspoon paprika

- 1 teaspoon all spice

- 1 teaspoon nutmeg

- 1 teaspoon cinnamon

### Directions

1. Chop all ingredients into small slithers or bite-size pieces. The garlic can be pressed through a crusher.

2. Place a small amount of olive oil in a very large pot and add the onions to lightly caremelise.

3. Add the rest of the ingredients to the pot and let cook on medium/low heat for about an hour.

4. Add vinegar, sugar and spices and mix through.

5. Cover the pot and let reduce until it becomes a chutney-like consistency, stirring regularly. A test for readyness is if a spoon can run through the chutney and leave a streak through the bottom of the pot.

6. Transfer to jar whilst still hot and firmly seal. If using recycled jars, the button seal should pop down once it has cooled. The vinegar should be enough to preserve without sterilisation.
