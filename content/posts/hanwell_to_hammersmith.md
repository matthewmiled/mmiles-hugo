> A walk along the River Brent and Thames, passing through Brentford.

### Route

This is the approximate route for the walk. You can see that it mostly follows the River Brent and Thames and finishes up in Hammersmith station.

### Sites

The walk started in Hanwell, which is west of Ealing and south of Wembley. At the time of the walk, the Elizabeth line had just opened so it was also my first time on the new service.

Hanwell station was built in the 19th century and has recently undergone a lot of renovation; it now just serves the Elizabeth line.

The main reason I travelled to this part of London was to see the Grade I listed Wharncliffe Viaduct, which is just a 5 minute walk from Hanwell station. The viaduct is nested within a green area along the River Brent.

I then walked south along the River Brent, stopping by Hanwell town itself. There is a pub that pays tribute to the Viaduct.

This stretch of the River Brent is relatively quiet and peaceful. Activity picks up slightly at some of the locks.

I continued all the way south down the river until I got to Brentford. I stopped in Verdict Bakery in the town center for some lunch. There was floating pontoon to facilitate some development works at Brentford lock.

I then kept following the river along the Grand Union Canal Walk until I got to Kew Bridge, where I stopped at the One Over the Ait pub. I crossed Kew Bridge south and joined the Thames Path, and then continuosly followed this path through Mortlake and all the way to Hammersmith Bridge (after a brief stop in the lovely The Ship pub near Chiswick Bridge).
