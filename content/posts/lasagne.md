### Directions

**Making the ragu bolognese sauce:**

1. Add butter and olive oil to a dutch oven and, once foaming, add the beef mince and sausage meat. Cook until the meat is no longer pink and then strain to reserve the rendered fat. Add the fat back to the pot and put the meat aside.

2. Add the diced carrot, celery, onion, garlic, sage and chilli flakes into the pot once the fat is heated. Cook for about 8 minutes until they have softened.

3. Add the crushed tomatoes and deglaze with wine, scraping the bottom of the pot. Add back the meat and also add the milk, stock and bay leaves, then bring to simmer on high heat. 

4. Give it a final stir once it has been simmering for a few minutes, then add to a low-heated oven (it can also be simmered over low heat instead). Cook for about 3 hours until the liquid is just below the meat level (stirring occasionally). For a lasagne, the sauce will reduce more when it is finnaly cooked, so try to make the sauce thinner than you would initially aim for. 

5. Once cooked add a splash of soy sauce and the heavy cream and simmer for another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. The bolognese will actually get slightly better once it's been left in a fridge for a couple of days, but can also be used to make a lasagne on the same day. Warm the sauce up when assembling the lasagne. 

**Making the ricotta mix:**

6. Whilst the bolognese is cooking, mix the ricotta with 2 eggs and chopped basil and parsley. Whisk until a smooth mixture has formed and season to taste.

**Making the besciamella:**

7. Heat butter in a pan and, once foaming, add the flour and whisk to combine. Once incorporated, add the garlic and fry gently. 

8. Whilst maintaining a low heat, slowly add the milk and whisk continiuosly. The mixture should thicken as it is gently brought to a simmer. Remove from heat and add the grated mozzarella (or cheese of choice) and nutmeg. Season to taste and set aside.

**Assembly and cooking:**

9. Pre-heat the oven to medium heat. Assemble the lasagne by placing layer of meat sauce, layer of ricotta, layer of besciamella, layer of lasagne sheets and then layer of optional parmesan.

10. Repeat until the dish is full and make sure the top layer is besciamella and/or parmesan.

11. Place in oven and cook until the top is crisped up and it is fully cooked through (about 45 minutes). Rotate half way through to ensure even cooking. Leave to rest for 20 minutes before cutting and add optional basil leaves to top.
