> Slow cooking the meat in a cast iron dutch oven is essential for this recipe. More vegetables can be added depending on preference, but adding just carrots for the last hour of cooking gives a simple contrast and ensures that the meat is super tender whilst the carrots have a slightly harder al dente texture. Served with baked mashed potatoes.

### Directions

**Preparing the meat and sauce:**

1. Generously salt the beef joint and leave to rest for about 30 mins. Optionally remove any large portions of fat, but the fat will melt down during the cooking process.

2. Heat a small amout of oil in a dutch oven over the hob and pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees celsius. Add the joint to the pot and sear all sides until browned. Medium heat works fine for this, and allows you to take time browning the meat whilst ensuring the fond does not burn.

3. Remove the meat once browned and add the diced red onion, and some diced celery and carrot for the mirepoix (if using).

4. Stir for about a minute (it does not have to fully cook) and add a large squirt of tomato puree and 2 tbsp of flour. Scrape the fond from the bottom of the pot and mix well to prevent any clumping. 

5. Just before it starts buring, deglaze with a bottle of red wine and a can of chopped tomatoes.

6. Add a few glugs of worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and marmite (if using). Also add a few teaspoons of garlic powder and mix.

7. Add back the beef joint so it is partially submerged. Cover the dutch oven with lid and place in oven. It will need approximately 4 hours in total, but stir after 1.5 hours and add the carrots after 3 hours (see later steps for more details).

**Baked mashed potatoes:**
8. When the meat goes into the oven, also place the whole potatoes onto the oven rack and bake for approximately 1.5 hours. 

9. Remove the potatoes once they can be easily pierced (at this point also give the pot roast a stir).

10. Leave the potatoes to cool, and then scoop out the flesh and add to a bowl. Mash them to the desired texture, and chop up the garlic (approx. 1 large clove per potato).

11. Add about 1 stick of butter per 2 potatoes to a saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, add the garlic and coat in the butter and immediately remove from heat. 

12. Add the mashed potato mix and salt to taste. Add milk if necessary to bring to desired texture.

**Cooking the meat:**
13. Once the meat has been in for 1.5 hours, give it a stir and re-cover. 

14. Continue cooking until the meat is near the desired super-tender texture and the red wine sauce has reduced significantly. This will approximately take another 1.5 hours (so 3 hours in total) depending on oven and other factors. 

15. The meat should easily be pulled apart at this point, but it will still get more tender. Peel and chop carrots into large-ish chunks (approx. 2 carrots per person) and add them to the pot. Do not completely suberge the carrots in the sauce to allow for browning. Place back in the oven for another hour with the lid removed.

16. After approximately 4 hours of total cooking the meat should easily fall apart and the larger carrot pieces should be cooked but not mushy. Remove from oven and add some chopped fresh rosemary, a glug of balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. 

17. Plate up alongside a heap of baked mashed potatoes.
